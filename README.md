SimShack is a **flight simulation companion app** for Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, 2020 or xPlane.

## ðŸ“¦ Download
[Download SimShack for Windows](https://github.com/Hammy915WS/Sim-Shack---Installer/releases/download/v1.0.0/SimShack.msi)

NOTE: Due to this application being utilized for a group of hobbyists, I did not get this application
Certificate of Authority Certified as the costs to do so are something I cannot afford. If you get a
Microsoft Defender SmartScreen, select More Info and "Run anyway". There is nothing destructive
about this application. If you are not confident with that, then run a scan on the SimShack.msi file before
attempting the installation. I would not put my name out there if there was going to be an issue.

## Features
- Airport quick search (using OurAirports data)
- Custom-built in VB.NET
- Compatible with Windows 10/11
- MSI installer (48 MB)
- Provides live Metar if available as well as D-ATIS
  
It is a robust Windows client that presents OurAirports data in a simple easy-to-read format that covers every airport in the world that is within their data. The application was developed for the Flight Sim world to identify airports and navaids with GPS precision.

It also covers aircraft specifications for a variety of manufacturers. The aircraft data will be an ongoing project to get it updated to make it as accurate as possible.

There is also a Calculate / Convert section for simple flight planning and conversions.
